    "\n",
    "Most of us learned in high school that we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the straight-line distance between two points. The theorem can be written as an equation that relates the 3 sides of a triangle:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a2 + b2 = c2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, given point (x1,y1) and point (x2,y2) the distance between them is equal to the square root of sum of  (x1 - x2) and (y1 - y2).  This is known as the **Euclidean distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this method to calculate the distance between two international airports, Seattle Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and Dallas / Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). We can get the geographic coordinates for these places via a search http://geonames.org. The following coordinates, in latitude-longitude order, were retrieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 47.449, -122.309 # Seattle Tacoma International Airport (SEA)\n",
    "- 32.896, -97.037 # Dallas / Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between these two airports, according to the Great Circle Mapper (http://www.gcmap.com/) is **1660** miles or **2671.5** kilometers (km). Let's figure out the best method to calculate an accurate distance between these locations and why.\n",

    "Using the spherical model, our distance is now only 3.5 km off of the Great Circle Mapper. That's pretty good. Why not just call it a day? There are two main reasons: 1) because some applications require a higher level of accuracy (e.g., a drone delivering your package) and  2) because the earth, as much as we would like to to be, is not a sphere.  Its shape is closer to an **ellipsoid** (which is sometimes refered to as a spheriod). We have only calculated the distance between two points on the earth.

We do this so we can produce 2D visualizations of geographic locations, e.g., printed maps and on computer screens. We also need map projections because ellipsoidal calculations more complex than point distances are too computationally intensive and are not widely implemented.  Map projections are designed to minimize distortion in area, shape, distance and/or direction for specific regions on the earth. No map projection can eliminate all forms of distortion for all regions. The selection of the appropriate map projection is extremely important and must be made with respect to the needs of the application at hand.\n",

    "- Measuring distance between two points within a small geographic regions can be extremely accurate and fast using projected data. This approach scales up well when working with large amounts of data or many complex spatial calculations.\n",
    "- For larger distances (and areas), calculations will be more accurate on a spheriod that with a planar map projection, but a bit slower. This is because map projections are designed to minimize distortion within a specifc region - the larger the region the more distortion as you transform space from a spheriod to a plane.\n",

    "- If your data is contained in a small area, you might find that choosing an appropriate projection and using GEOMETRY is the best solution, in terms of performance and functionality available.\n",
    "- If your data is global or covers a continental region, you may find that GEOGRAPHY allows you to build a system without having to worry about projection details. You store your data in longitude/latitude, and use the functions that have been defined on GEOGRAPHY.\n",
    "- If you don't understand projections, and you don't want to learn about them, and you're prepared to accept the limitations in functionality available in GEOGRAPHY, then it might be easier for you to use GEOGRAPHY than GEOMETRY. Simply load your data up as longitude/latitude and go from there.\n",
